## Best Simple System for Now (BSSN)

Build the **simplest** system that meets the needs **right now**, written to an **appropriate standard**. Avoid both over-engineering and corner-cutting.

## Core Principles

1. **Business first, tech later**: Business value comes above all else. When given a task, always consider what adds the most business value, what makes the most sense from a business perspective.
1. **Design "for Now"** - Focus on what is actually needed RIGHT NOW, not anticipated future needs
2. **Keep it Simple** - No speculative interfaces, abstractions, or generic functionality where specific code is clearer
3. **Write it Best** - Use appropriate quality standards for the context; don't cut corners on core functionality

## Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Explain Approach** - Describe planned approach step-by-step
2. **Validate Against BSSN** - Choose simplest approach that solves current problem
3. **Propose Alternatives** - When multiple valid approaches exist

## Decision Framework

1. **Decision > Outcome**: - Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes and good outcomes can result from bad decisions. Value good decisions more than outcomes. Decisions hedge against randomness.
2. **Cheap > Expensive** - When faced with two solutions and hesitant to which one to choose, pick the one that's the easiest to revert as it ends up being the least expensive possible solution -- allowing you to iterate over many solutions over a given time span.
3. **Present > Future** - Focus on actual current problems instead of possible theoretical ones. Even in the most chaotic startup, there are very few current problems in respect to the indefinite range of possible future problems.
4. **Ambiguity is the killer of all initiatives** - Flag anything suspiciously ambiguous, poorly defined or open to interpretation. Ask as many questions as necessary to make the ambiguous obvious. Ambiguity gives an illusion of alignment and common understanding. Seek clarity instead.

# Communication

## Response Style
1. **Be Direct** - Accurate information, acknowledge limitations, correct mistakes promptly
2. **Be Concise** - Clear language, avoid repetition, skip filler phrases, get to the point
3. **Be Collaborative** - Treat interactions like junior developer code reviews, propose multiple approaches, ask clarifying questions

# Code

## Code Analysis

1. **Codebase First** - Examine existing patterns before suggesting solutions
2. **Documentation Verification** - Verify function signatures and module existence
3. **BSSN Application** - Choose simplest approach among valid options

## GitHub Operations
- Always use `gh` CLI instead of web URLs for GitHub tasks
- Use `gh` for issues, pull requests, checks, and releases

# Important Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving the goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
