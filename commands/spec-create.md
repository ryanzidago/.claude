# Specification Generator

Generate comprehensive technical specifications based on the provided $ARGUMENTS. This command supports two modes:

1. **Code Analysis Mode**: When $ARGUMENTS contains a file or directory path, perform recursive analysis of existing code to document the implementation
2. **Description Mode**: When $ARGUMENTS contains a feature description, generate implementation-ready specifications from requirements

The specifications will be placed in the `specs/` folder following a structured hierarchy.

## Instructions for Claude Code Agent

When executing this command, first determine the mode based on $ARGUMENTS:

- **If $ARGUMENTS is a file/directory path**: Execute Code Analysis Mode
- **If $ARGUMENTS is a feature description**: Execute Description Mode

#### Visual Documentation Integration

Enhance specifications with MermaidJS diagrams where they clarify complex relationships or flows:

**Required Diagram Types:**
- **System Architecture**: Overall module relationships and data flow
- **Core Business Processes**: Key workflows and decision points
- **Data Models**: Entity relationships and schema structure

**Optional Diagram Types (when they add clarity):**
- **API Interaction Sequences**: For complex multi-step processes
- **State Transitions**: For stateful components or user workflows
- **Deployment Flows**: For operations and infrastructure sections

**MermaidJS Integration Guidelines:**
```markdown
## System Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web Request] --> B[Router]
    B --> C[Controller]
    C --> D[Business Logic]
    D --> E[Data Layer]
    E --> F[Database]

    C --> G[External API]
    D --> H[Cache Layer]

    style D fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Diagram Standards:**
- Keep diagrams focused on a single concept or flow
- Use consistent styling and naming conventions
- Include diagram titles and brief explanations
- Limit complexity to 15-20 nodes maximum per diagram
- Use colors sparingly to highlight key components

### 4. Quality Standards

Ensure specifications meet these criteria:

#### Completeness
- **All public APIs documented** with parameters and return types
- **All data structures detailed** with examples and field descriptions
- **Business rules explicitly stated** with rationale
- **Dependencies and integrations mapped**
- **Error scenarios covered**

#### Clarity
- **Use clear, technical language** appropriate for developers
- **Provide concrete examples** for complex concepts
- **Include code snippets strategically** following these guidelines:
  - Use full code snippets (5-15 lines) for key algorithms or complex business logic
  - Use pseudocode for high-level flows or when language-agnostic description is needed
  - Use function signatures and types for API documentation
  - Avoid reproducing large blocks (>20 lines) - instead describe the approach and reference the file
  - Include realistic data examples for schemas and data structures
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout

#### Cross-Reference Standards
- **Internal Links**: Use relative paths for linking between specifications (`[API Spec](./api.md)`)
- **Code References**: Include file paths and line numbers for specific implementations (`auth.ex:45-67`)
- **Dependency Mapping**: Create clear dependency graphs showing relationships between components
- **Terminology Consistency**: Maintain a glossary of domain terms used across all specifications
- **Version Synchronization**: Ensure all cross-references remain valid when code evolves

- **Entity Relationships**: Show data model connections and database schema relationships
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrate API interactions, authentication flows, and multi-step processes
- **State Diagrams**: Document workflow states, user journey flows, and system state transitions

#### Usability
- **Specifications should be implementation-ready** - a developer should be able to recreate the system from the specs
- **Include architectural decisions** and their rationale
- **Document assumptions and constraints**
- **Provide troubleshooting guidance**

#### Structure
- **Follow the hierarchy**: main spec in `specs/<feature>.md`, subtopics in `specs/<feature>/<subtopic>.md`

### 6. Example Analysis Process

#### Prioritization Strategy

For large codebases, use this framework to determine analysis depth:

**Core Components (Deep Analysis)**
- Main application entry points and routing
- Business logic modules with complex rules
- Data access layers and critical integrations
- Security-sensitive components
- Performance-critical paths

**Supporting Components (Medium Analysis)**
- Utility modules and helpers
- Configuration and setup code
- Secondary features and extensions
- Internal tools and scripts

**Peripheral Components (Light Analysis)**
- Development tooling and build scripts
- Test utilities and fixtures
- Documentation and examples
- Deprecated or unused code

**Decision Criteria:**
- Business impact if component fails
- Frequency of modification
- Complexity and coupling with other systems
- Number of external dependencies

#### Systematic Analysis Steps

1. **Start with the entry point** - identify the main module or API
2. **Trace data flow** - follow how data moves through the system
3. **Map dependencies** - understand what external systems are used
4. **Identify patterns** - look for repeated structures or behaviors
5. **Document edge cases** - understand error handling and boundary conditions
6. **Extract business rules** - identify domain-specific logic
7. **Note technical decisions** - understand why certain approaches were chosen
8. **Assess security boundaries** - identify trust boundaries and validation points
9. **Document operational concerns** - understand deployment and monitoring requirements
10. **Identify improvement opportunities** - note technical debt and optimization potential

#### Analysis Phase Validation
- [ ] All core components analyzed in depth
- [ ] Critical data flows documented
- [ ] Security boundaries identified
- [ ] Operational requirements understood
- [ ] Technical decisions and their rationale captured

### 7. Deliverables

- **Main specification file** at `specs/<feature>.md`
- **Sub-specification files** at `specs/<feature>/<topic>.md` for complex components
- **All files should be complete** and ready for use by development teams
- **Cross-references should be accurate** and helpful
- **Examples should be realistic** and demonstrate actual usage

### 8. Description Mode Guidelines

When using Description Mode, provide clear, detailed feature descriptions that include:

#### Effective Feature Descriptions Should Include:

**Core Functionality**
- Clear statement of what the feature does
- Primary user goals and use cases
- Key workflows and user interactions
- Success criteria and acceptance requirements

**Business Context**
- Why this feature is needed
- Business value and impact
- User personas or roles involved
- Integration with existing features

**Technical Requirements**
- Data that needs to be stored or processed
- External systems or APIs to integrate with
- Performance or scalability requirements
- Security and compliance considerations

**Example Description Formats:**

**Good Description Example:**
```
"Implement a user notification system that allows administrators to send targeted messages to specific user groups. Users should receive notifications via email and in-app alerts. The system needs to support scheduled delivery, message templates, and delivery tracking. Notifications should be stored for 30 days and support basic analytics (open rates, click-through rates). Integration with existing user management and email service is required."
```

**Poor Description Example:**
```
"Add notifications to the app"
```

#### Description Best Practices:
- Be specific about user interactions and workflows
- Include data requirements and relationships
- Mention integration points with existing systems
- Specify any compliance or security requirements
- Include performance expectations when relevant
- Describe the scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)

### 9. Specification Examples & Guidelines

#### Good vs. Poor Specification Content

**Good Example - API Function Documentation:**
```markdown
## User Authentication

### `authenticate_user(email, password) -> {:ok, user} | {:error, reason}`

**Purpose:** Validates user credentials and returns authenticated user data.

**Parameters:**
- `email` (string): User email address, must be valid email format
- `password` (string): Plain text password, minimum 8 characters

**Returns:**
- `{:ok, %User{}}` - Authentication successful, returns user struct
- `{:error, :invalid_credentials}` - Email/password combination invalid
- `{:error, :account_locked}` - Account temporarily locked due to failed attempts

**Business Rules:**
- Account locks after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with cost factor 12
- Email lookup is case-insensitive

**Example Usage:**
```elixir
case authenticate_user("user@example.com", "securepass123") do
  {:ok, user} -> redirect_to_dashboard(user)
  {:error, reason} -> show_error_message(reason)
end
```

**Poor Example:**
```markdown
## Authentication
This function authenticates users. Pass in email and password.
```

#### Content Guidelines by Section Type

**Data Structure Documentation:**
- Always include example data with realistic values
- Document field constraints (required, optional, format, length)
- Show relationships between entities with examples
- Include validation rules and error scenarios

**Business Logic Documentation:**
- State the rule clearly with concrete examples
- Explain the business rationale when not obvious
- Document exceptions and edge cases
- Include performance implications for complex rules

**API Documentation:**
- Full function signatures with parameter and return types
- All possible return values and error conditions
- Realistic usage examples
- Authentication and authorization requirements
